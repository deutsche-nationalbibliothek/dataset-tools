### Creating a new datashed

The `init` command is used to create a new _datashed_ project. The
following command creates a new project `demo`.

```console
$ datashed init demo
```

Alternatively, a project can be initialized inside an existing
directory:

```console
$ mkdir demo && cd demo
$ datashed init .
```

#### Project structure

An empty project consists of the following files and directories:

```console
$ tree demo
├── data
├── datashed.toml
└── tmp
```

The `data` directory contains the documents of the datashed. It is up
to the user to set up an ingest process, e.g. in the form of a Python
script. The `datashed.toml` contains metadata about the project and
important runtime options.

```toml
[metadata]
name = "demo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com"]  
```

The metadata can be changed by command line options (see `datashed init
--help`). By default, the name of the project is the directory name,
the initial version is `0.1.0` and the author is derived from the Git
identity (if possible). The project is also automatically initialized
as a Git repository. This behavior can be deactivated using the `--vcs
none` option.

### Archive

The `archive` command can be used to create a backup of a datashed. It
creates a `tar.gz` archive containing all documents, the configuration
and the current index. It is important to note, that only the documents
contained in the index are archived. If there are documents that have
not yet been indexed, the index should be updated first. By default,
the compression is biased towards high compression ratio at expense of
speed. This behavior can be changed using the `--fast` or `--best` flag.

```console
$ datashed archive -o ~/tmp/backup.tar.gz
Archive documents: 3 (100%) | elapsed: 00:00:00, done.
```
