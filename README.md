# dataset-tools

This project contains tools for data preparation, transformation and
analysis to create text corpora that can be processed with [Annif]. The
tools are based on experiments and prototypes that were developed as
part of the research work in the _Automated Indexing System_ project of
the [German National Library].

The tools are not yet ready for productive use; no support is provided.
